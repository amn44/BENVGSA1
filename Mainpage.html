The UK Government has set a target for 70% of the population to complete 30 minutes of moderate exercise 5 times a week by 2020 <sup>[1]</sup>, but what does the picture of London currently look like?
<br> Use the map below to explore results from the Active People Survey. The Active People Survey provides the most comprehensive picture of sports participation in London, helping to understand the extent of inequality in sporting opportunities.

	<!--b>parkrun : a success story</b><br-->
	You might have noticed parkrun as an activity in the opportunity map. Parkrun is a community driven movement that set up timed 5km runs in public parks every single week.
	<!--The parkrun events are accessible to all, no matter your running ability. -->You are free to walk, run, bring your dog, push a buggy, and there are even volunteers to assist those with wheelchairs or visual impairments (at certain courses). 
	Take a look at the following video to learn all about how they started, where they take place, and how they grew across London.<br>
	
	If you’ve been inspired by their story, find a parkrun near you, and join them at 9am on Saturdays! They are totally free to join, just register at <a href=“www.parkrun.org.uk” target=“_blank”>www.parkrun.org.uk</a> before you turn up.

      <h1>conversation</h1>
      <p id="textNarrative">What sort of detailed topics and languages are conveyed when people communicate about large sporting events in London, in terms of social media (Twitter activity)? <br>

The following video shows a snapshot of these communications at the corresponding location of where the events took place. They are Parkrun at Hackney Marshes, the 2018 London Marathon and Women’s FA cup finals at the Wembley Stadium.

They each are chosen to represent a public event, a semi-professional event and a professional yet not highly commercial event.
